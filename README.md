### **What is Git and Github? What is the difference?**
* Git is version control software where it can be used anywhere (universal)
* Github is basically git but a place to share your code. It's like a social Git and it's a website where you create an account and projects through the management of Git.
  * Repository **(repo for short)** is basically a project you can create on Github (A fresh clean template). In the repo, you can create files for different types of purposes **(different formats for files like .md .txt .html .css etc...)**
  * Commit **(or save changes)** basically ingrains the changes you've made in your files, pratically saving your work. Before commit, you'll have to write something into text bar and it could literally be anything. Usually people write what they need to do next or simply the word "done".

**TD;LR- Git is like the knowledge, Github is a school, repository is the projects, H.W, C.W, etc.**
